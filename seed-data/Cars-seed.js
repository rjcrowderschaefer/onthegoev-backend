        review: "The 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 offers an expertly crafted and spacious cabin, two solid powertrains, a smooth ride and a wealth of standard features. It also has excellent driving range. The trunk is small, and the rear row could use more headroom, but the Ioniq 6 is still a great electric car overall.",
